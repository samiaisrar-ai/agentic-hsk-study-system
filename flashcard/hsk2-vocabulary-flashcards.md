**Answer**: 正在 (zhèngzài) provides stronger emphasis on the progressive aspect, explicitly indicating that an action is currently in progress at the moment of speaking (e.g., "I am currently studying"). Using 在 alone before a verb also indicates ongoing action but with less emphasis on the immediate present moment.

---

---

### Card 323
**Question**: Explain the usage of 一下 (yíxià) as a verbal complement.

**Answer**: 一下 (yíxià) follows verbs to indicate a brief, casual, or tentative action. It softens requests or suggestions and implies that the action is not extensive (e.g., 看一下 "take a look," 试一下 "give it a try"). It makes expressions less forceful and more colloquial.

---

### Card 324

---

### Card 342
**Question**: Examine the structural components and semantic implications of the compound word 火车站 (huǒchēzhàn).

**Answer**: 火车站 decomposes into 火车 (train, literally "fire vehicle") + 站 (station/stop). The compound follows the pattern of vehicle type + station, creating a specific location noun. This structure parallels similar compounds like 汽车站 (bus station), demonstrating Chinese word-formation patterns that combine specific vehicle types with the generic station marker.

---

### Card 343
**Question**: Distinguish between the three third-person pronouns 他 (tā), 她 (tā), and 它 (tā) in written versus spoken Chinese.

**Answer**: In spoken Mandarin, all three pronouns are pronounced identically as "tā," with gender and animacy distinctions conveyed through context. In written Chinese, they are differentiated: 他 (male/mixed gender), 她 (female), and 它 (inanimate objects or animals). This represents a divergence between the homophonic spoken form and the semantically distinct written forms.

---

### Card 344
**Question**: Analyze the measure word system by comparing 本 (běn), 张 (zhāng), and 双 (shuāng) in terms of noun categorization.

**Answer**: Measure words categorize nouns by physical characteristics: 本 (běn) applies to bound objects like books and notebooks; 张 (zhāng) applies to flat objects such as paper, tables, and tickets; 双 (shuāng) specifically denotes pairs, particularly of items worn in pairs like shoes and socks. This system reflects how Chinese grammar encodes physical properties and quantity relationships through mandatory classifiers.

---

### Card 345
**Question**: Examine the semantic relationship and functional differences among 看 (kàn), 看见 (kànjiàn), and 看书 (kàn shū).

**Answer**: 看 functions as a versatile verb meaning "to look/watch/read"; 看见 adds a resultative complement (见) to indicate successful perception—the result of looking; 看书 represents a verb-object compound specifically meaning "to read books." This demonstrates how Chinese builds specificity through: basic verb → verb + resultative → verb-object compounds.

---

### Card 346
**Question**: Analyze the progression of quantity expressions: 一点儿 (yìdiǎnr), 一些 (yīxiē), 一下 (yíxià), distinguishing their functions.

**Answer**: Though all contain "一," they serve distinct functions: 一点儿 quantifies small amounts of uncountable nouns or degrees of adjectives (e.g., "a little tired"); 一些 quantifies plural countable or uncountable nouns (e.g., "some people"); 一下 functions as a verbal complement indicating brief action (e.g., "look briefly"). They represent quantity, plurality, and aspectual modification respectively.

---

### Card 347
**Question**: Examine how the characters 大 (dà) and 小 (xiǎo) function both as independent adjectives and as components in compound words.

**Answer**: As independent adjectives, 大 means "big" and 小 means "small" (e.g., 大房间 "big room"). As compound components, they modify semantic domains: 大学 (university, "big learning"), 小姐 (Miss, "small/young lady"), 小时 (hour, "small time unit"). Their incorporation extends beyond physical size to indicate hierarchy, age, or categorical distinctions.

### Card 348
**Question**: Analyze the aspectual particle system comparing 了 (le), 着 (zhe), and 过 (guò) in terms of temporal and aspectual meanings.

**Answer**: These particles encode different aspects: 了 marks completion or change of state (perfective aspect); 着 indicates ongoing state or duration (durative aspect); 过 denotes past experience without specifying time (experiential aspect). For example, 吃了 (ate/finished eating), 开着 (is open/opened), 吃过 (have eaten before). They create a multidimensional aspectual system distinguishing completion, duration, and experience.

### Card 349
**Question**: Compare and contrast the directional verbs 来 (lái) and 去 (qù) in terms of deictic center and perspective.

**Answer**: 来 indicates movement toward the speaker or deictic center ("to come"), while 去 indicates movement away from the speaker toward another location ("to go"). The distinction is perspective-dependent: the same movement can be described with either verb depending on the speaker's position. This deictic system centers spatial reference on the speaker's location or psychological perspective.

### Card 350
**Question**: Analyze the relationship between 认识 (rènshi), 知道 (zhīdào), and 懂 (dǒng) as verbs of knowledge.

**Answer**: These verbs encode different knowledge types: 认识 indicates personal acquaintance or recognition (knowing people, characters); 知道 represents factual awareness or knowledge of information (knowing facts); 懂 signifies comprehension and understanding (grasping meaning). For instance, one can 认识 a person, 知道 their name, and 懂 their intentions—representing acquaintance, factual knowledge, and comprehension respectively.

### Card 351
**Question**: Examine the structural and semantic differences between 上午 (shàngwǔ), 下午 (xiàwǔ), and 晚上 (wǎnshang) as time divisions.

**Answer**: These compounds divide the day using directional metaphors: 上午 (morning, "up-noon") and 下午 (afternoon, "down-noon") position morning as ascending and afternoon as descending relative to noon. 晚上 (evening/night, "late-up") marks the late portion of the day. This system reflects a spatial metaphor where time ascends to midday, then descends, demonstrating how Chinese conceptualizes temporal progression through spatial relationships.

---

### Card 352
**Question**: Analyze how the word 过 (guò) functions differently as a verb, complement, and particle.

**Answer**: As a verb, 过 means "to pass/cross" (过马路 "cross the street"). As a directional complement, it indicates movement across or past (走过来 "walk over"). As an experiential particle, it marks past experience (去过 "have been to"). These functions share the core meaning of "passing," extended metaphorically from spatial passage to temporal experience, demonstrating systematic polysemy in Chinese grammar.

## Evaluate (Evaluation)

### Card 353
**Question**: Evaluate which verb, 会 (huì) or 能 (néng), would be more appropriate to use when asking if someone can swim, and justify the choice.

**Answer**: 会 (huì) would be more appropriate: 你会游泳吗? This choice reflects that swimming is a learned skill requiring practice and training. Using 能 would suggest a momentary capability or permission issue rather than acquired ability. However, 能 might be appropriate if asking whether someone is physically able to swim at a particular moment (e.g., due to injury), demonstrating how context determines optimal selection.

---

### Card 354
**Question**: Assess whether 高兴 (gāoxìng) or 快乐 (kuàilè) is more suitable for congratulating someone who passed an examination.

**Answer**: 高兴 (gāoxìng) is more suitable in this context: 你一定很高兴! This selection is justified because 高兴 denotes situational happiness resulting from specific events, whereas 快乐 expresses more general, sustained joy typically used in greetings or wishes. The examination success represents a specific achievement warranting 高兴 rather than the broader sentiment of 快乐.

---

### Card 355
**Question**: Determine whether 因为 (yīnwèi) or 所以 (suǒyǐ) should be emphasized when explaining a decision to stay home due to illness.

**Answer**: Both can be used, but emphasis affects meaning: prioritizing 因为 (因为我生病了,所以在家休息) emphasizes the reason; prioritizing 所以 or omitting 因为 (我生病了,所以在家休息) emphasizes the consequence. For explanatory contexts where justification is primary, beginning with 因为 is more appropriate. For contexts emphasizing logical conclusion, highlighting 所以 is preferable, demonstrating how information structure affects pragmatic focus.

---

### Card 356
**Question**: Evaluate whether 看 (kàn) or 看见 (kànjiàn) is more appropriate when describing unintentionally noticing a friend at a restaurant.

**Answer**: 看见 (kànjiàn) is more appropriate: 我在餐厅看见了朋友. This choice emphasizes the resultative aspect—successfully perceiving the friend—which aligns with unintentional noticing. Using 看 alone would suggest intentional looking, which contradicts the context of incidental perception. The resultative complement 见 specifically marks achieved perception, making 看见 the optimal choice for describing spontaneous visual encounters.

---

### Card 357
**Question**: Assess the appropriateness of using 老师 (lǎoshī) versus 先生 (xiānsheng) when addressing an educator in a formal academic setting.

**Answer**: 老师 (lǎoshī) is more appropriate in educational contexts when addressing or referring to educators: 王老师. This term specifically denotes the teaching profession and carries educational respect. 先生 is a general honorific meaning "Mr." or "sir," used more broadly and not specifically in educational contexts. While 先生 conveys respect, 老师 better acknowledges professional role and is conventional in academic settings, making it the culturally preferred choice.

---

### Card 358
**Question**: Determine whether 买 (mǎi) or 卖 (mài) would be used from the customer's perspective in a commercial transaction at a market.

**Answer**: From the customer's perspective, 买 (mǎi) "to buy" is appropriate: 我要买水果. The customer is the purchasing agent, thus performing the buying action. The vendor would use 卖 (mài) "to sell": 我卖水果. This demonstrates how perspective determines verb selection in transactional contexts, with each participant using the verb corresponding to their role in the exchange.

---

### Card 359
**Question**: Evaluate whether 一点儿 (yìdiǎnr) or 一些 (yīxiē) is more suitable when offering a small quantity of tea to a guest.

**Answer**: 一点儿 (yìdiǎnr) is more appropriate: 喝一点儿茶吧. This choice reflects politeness and modesty, suggesting a small amount without imposing. 一些 suggests a more substantial quantity of multiple items. Additionally, 一点儿 better suits uncountable nouns like tea and carries a softer, more hospitable tone in offers. The diminutive quality of 一点儿 aligns with Chinese politeness conventions when making offers.

---

### Card 360
**Question**: Assess which time expression, 时候 (shíhou) or 时间 (shíjiān), is more appropriate when asking "When do you eat breakfast?"

**Answer**: 时候 (shíhou) is more appropriate: 你什么时候吃早饭? This choice suits questions about specific moments or occasions when events occur. 时间 would be more suitable for questions about duration or available time ("Do you have time?"). The question seeks a point in time (e.g., "8 AM"), not a duration, making 时候 the optimal selection for temporal point reference.

## Study Recommendations

- **Initial Review**: Study all cards in sequence by Bloom level, beginning with Remember-level vocabulary acquisition to build foundational lexical knowledge.
- **Spaced Repetition**: Review cards at increasing intervals (1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days) to optimize long-term retention through distributed practice.
- **Active Recall**: Attempt to answer each question before revealing the response, engaging retrieval processes that strengthen memory consolidation.
- **Mixed Practice**: Once familiar with individual levels, shuffle cards across Bloom levels to engage in interleaved practice, which enhances discrimination and flexible application.
- **Focus Areas**: Allocate additional review time to higher cognitive levels (Analyze, Evaluate, Create) as these require deeper processing and integration of multiple vocabulary items.
- **Pronunciation Practice**: Regularly practice pinyin pronunciation aloud to reinforce phonological representations alongside orthographic and semantic knowledge.
- **Contextual Application**: Supplement flashcard study with authentic materials (texts, conversations) to encounter vocabulary in natural contexts.
- **Production Practice**: Regularly attempt Create-level cards to develop active productive competence, not merely passive recognition.
